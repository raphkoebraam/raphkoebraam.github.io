Yes, in a way or another, bad days <em>do</em> come. It might be losing a loved one, health issues, lay-offs, a financial crisis, a war. And no, we're not prepared for them, not even in the slightest.</p><p>In a sense, it's not something we consider in life. We're conditioned to consider and think about the good things that can happen. After all, who wants to deal with the bad things? Who wants to not have control over everything? And yet, they happen.</p><p>Not only they happen, but they help to put you back in your place. They make you rethink and reconsider priorities in life. They humble you. They make you realize that you have no control at all. And when you realize it, what are you going to do? If you don't have a firm foundation, you are going to fall apart. And I can guarantee to you, there's no firmer foundation than the Rock of Ages.</p><p>If there's one thing I knew it would happen in life, it was tribulation. When it happened, I took heart, for <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A33&version=ESV">He has overcome the world</a>. I held onto the hope of Christ, knowing that one day <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A4&version=ESV">He will wipe away every tear from our eyes.</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204%3A17-18&version=ESV">2 Corinthians 4:17-18</a> reads: "For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal."</p><p>No matter what happens, God is still sovereign and He is still good. Nothing can change that.</p><p>As Charles H. Spurgeon once said:</p><blockquote><p>I have learned to kiss the waves that throw me up against the Rock of Ages.</p></blockquote></div></article></div><footer><p>Copyright Â© 2016-2024 Raphael Koebraam</p><p>In between the 0s and 1s</p><p>Built with Swift + <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/raphkoebraam" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphkoebraam" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="/feed.rss">RSS</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/raphkoebraam" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
