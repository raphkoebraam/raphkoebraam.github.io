Not one about a specific subject - as I do have <a href="http://www.veganeagora.com">one</a>. Just a blog, a place where I could write and post my thoughts online.</p><p>I "tried" it once, made only one post, and that was it, no more writing. The excuses were always the same: <em>I don't have time</em>, <em>too tired today</em>, <em>I'll write about it tomorrow</em>, and so on. Turns out I did not manage my time properly to take a moment to write about my perspective of life and how I see it through my eyes or anything else I would like to, as I wanted to in first place. Worst than that, I was not allowing myself to breathe at all. And it started to bug me.</p><p>Recently I went to Europe, where I took a moment to reflect about this situation. I realized it's really common in our <em>modern life</em>. We're always busy, always looking for the future and never living the present - when I say <em>we</em>, I mean almost everyone, forgive me about the generalization. We do not allow ourselves to take a moment, to enjoy life at its fullest. We just keep going, keep existing, without really living, without really enjoying life. I'll not go any further on this topic, because I intend to write more about it.</p><p>That being said, I decided to change what did bug me, analyzing the way I prioritize what to do, what to learn, hobbies and so on. I started reflecting more on living rather than only existing.</p><p>This blog is the start of this change. It's <em>the beginning</em>.</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Copyright Â© 2016-2024 Raphael Koebraam</p><p>In between the 0s and 1s</p><p>Built with Swift + <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/raphkoebraam" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphkoebraam" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="/feed.rss">RSS</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/raphkoebraam" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
